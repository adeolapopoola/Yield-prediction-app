        '''Welcome to the Yield Prophet App! This application uses advanced machine learning models to predict crop yields based on historical data, environmental factors, and crop-specific parameters. Whether you're a farmer, agricultural researcher, or just curious, my goal is to provide accurate predictions to support decision-making and enhance productivity in agriculture.

**Features**: 
This app harnesses the power of advanced machine learning algorithms to forecast crop yields with high accuracy. Here are some of the key features:

**Predictive Models**:
- ARIMA Model: Uses the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model for time series forecasting.
- Neural Networks(RÂ²= 0.93): Utilizes deep learning techniques to predict complex patterns in crop yield data.
- XGBoost (89%): Uses extreme gradient boosting for efficient and accurate predictions.

**Interactive Visualization**: 
Visualize trends and predicted yields with interactive and user-friendly visualizations.
**Customizable Inputs**: 
Allows users to input parameters such as weather conditions to tailor predictions.

**Data**: 
This app contains data for about 150 countries and 296 crops.


**Data Sources**:
- Food and Agricultural Organisation (https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data)
- Our World in Data (https://ourworldindata.org)
- Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)



**Feedback**:
Your feedback is valuable to me! If you have suggestions or encounter any issues while using the app, please reach out to me via email at deolapopson@gmail.com


Thank you for using the Yield Prophet App!
